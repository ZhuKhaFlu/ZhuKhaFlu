### Hi there 

Hi I'm currently studing an Engeneering in Computer Tecnologies in Tec de Monterrey. I'm mainly focused in Cybersecurity and it's uses, this is because I wish to live in a world where can feel relaxed and calm knowing that my information is safe and secure and nobody will try to take advantage of me.

I currently hold the Help Desk position at Quanti Solutins SA de CV.
